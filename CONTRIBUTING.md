# Contributing

Thanks for your interest! Please follow these steps to contribute:

1. Fork the repo and create a branch: `git checkout -b feature/short-description`
2. Run tests and linters locally (see `README.md` for commands).
3. Make clear, small commits. Use imperative commit messages (e.g. "Fix typo in README").
4. Open a Pull Request describing:
   - What you changed
   - Why itâ€™s needed
   - Link to any related issue (`Fixes #123`)

We welcome code, docs, tests, translations, and non-code tasks. See `ISSUE_TEMPLATE` for tasks suitable for first-time contributors.

**Code of Conduct:** Please be kind and respectful. Violations may result in removal from the project.
